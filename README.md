# Overview
Welcome to my project! Here, I took on the challenge of recreating the layout of Amazon.com's homepage using only HTML and CSS. This project marks my initial steps into the world of web design and development.

My primary objective was to replicate the visual elements and structure of Amazon's homepage. By focusing solely on HTML and CSS, I aimed to grasp the fundamentals of front-end development, emphasizing clean coding practices for an aesthetically pleasing interface. 

The motivation behind this project was to gain practical experience in web development. Replicating Amazon's homepage, a widely recognized and complex interface, provided an excellent opportunity to delve into front-end design principles.
